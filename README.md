# ğŸš€ JavaScript Data Structure - Outer Space Edition! ğŸš€

---

Greetings Earthling! ğŸ‘½ Welcome to the far reaches of the cosmos where data structures aren't just cool, they are **interstellar**! This space capsule contains an out-of-this-world collection of JavaScript data structures that will have you coding at light speed. ğŸŒŒ

But wait, there's more! This cosmic repository comes with its own space-age testing facility in a Docker container! Watch in awe as your code is put through an intergalactic obstacle course of test cases. ğŸŒ 

## ğŸŒ• Pre-flight Checks ğŸŒ•

Before blasting off into space, make sure that your spacecraft is equipped with Docker, the interstellar technology that lets you run containers. These containers are like little spaceships ğŸš€ for your code.

## ğŸŒŸ Launch Sequence ğŸŒŸ

Ready to launch? Buckle up, put on your space helmet, and engage thrusters. Time to run all the test cases inside a Docker container. ğŸ›¸ Use this ancient alien incantation to initiate the launch sequence:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### ğŸŒŒ What to Expect ğŸŒŒ

As the Docker container blasts off, you will traverse wormholes, fly past code asteroids and experience zero-gravity as your JavaScript data structures are put to the test. This is the real deal - testing like a space ranger! ğŸš€

### ğŸ›° Stay in Orbit ğŸ›°

Don't just jet off once the tests are done! Stay in orbit, explore the uncharted territories of your code. Found a bug? That's not a bug, that's an alien! ğŸ‘½  Treat it well, and refactor.

**Disclaimer**: In case of contact with extraterrestrial life during code testing, remember to stay calm and avoid any references to world domination or probing. Happy coding, Space Explorer! ğŸŒ
